**Surface** is a project demonstrating how to use and manage **Git submodules**.  
It includes another GitHub repository ‚Äî [submarines](https://github.com/your-username/submarines) ‚Äî as a submodule to 
highlight modular and reusable code design.
You want to be able to treat the two projects as separate yet still be able to use one from within the other.

## What is a Git Submodule?

A Git submodule is a way to include another Git repository within your own project as a dependency. This is useful for:
- Reusing shared libraries or components across multiple projects.
- Keeping separate version histories for modular parts.
- Avoiding copy-pasting code between projects.

##  How to Clone This Project with Submodules

in git bash run the below command:
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/your-username/surface.git

If you've already cloned it without the --recurse-submodules flag, then follow these steps:
cd surface
git submodule update --init --recursive

## Pulling in Upstream Changes from the Submodule Remote

When you add a submodule, it tracks a specific commit, not a branch.
So even if the submodule repo is updated (new commits), your project won‚Äôt see them unless you update it manually.

bash
git submodule update --remote

Tells Git to:

Go into each submodule

Fetch from its remote origin

Checkout the latest commit on the configured branch (e.g., main)

Then, in your parent repo, you‚Äôll see that the submodule pointer has moved to this newer commit.

üîß Example
Let's say your submarines submodule has a new commit pushed to its main branch:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd surface
git submodule update --remote
‚û°Ô∏è Git goes into submarines, pulls the latest commit from its remote main branch, and checks it out.

But remember:
This does NOT automatically commit the change to the parent repo.
You still need to do this:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add submarines
git commit -m "Update submarines submodule to latest commit"
git push
‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
You can configure which branch a submodule tracks:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Inside your submodule folder
git checkout main

# Back in root repo
git config -f .gitmodules submodule.submarines.branch main
This makes --remote always fetch from the main branch of the submarines submodule.
